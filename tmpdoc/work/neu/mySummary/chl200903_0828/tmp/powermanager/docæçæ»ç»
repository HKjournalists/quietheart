1,gs-2.22.2,gnome-screensaver:
===============================

	gnome-screensaver is a screen saver and locker that aims to have
simple, sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop.
It is designed to support:
        * the ability to lock down configuration settings
        * translation into many languages
        * user switching

DBUS相关信息：
==========
    GNOME Screensaver exposes a DBUS API for programs to obtain information about the screensaver state and to interact with the screensaver in limited ways.
      The following constants are used to uniquely refer to the GnomeScreensaver object when making DBUS method calls:

DBUS Service:org.gnome.ScreenSaver
DBUS Object Path:/org/gnome/ScreenSaver
DBUS Interface:org.gnome.ScreenSaver
DBUS methods:
参见dbus-interface.xml


举例：
==========

You can activate the screensaver like so:
dbus-send --session \
          --dest=org.gnome.ScreenSaver \
          --type=method_call \
          --print-reply \
          --reply-timeout=20000 \
          /org/gnome/ScreenSaver \
          org.gnome.ScreenSaver.SetActive \
          boolean:true


You can monitor screensaver changes:
dbus-monitor --session \
          "type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver'"

Or watch for a specific screensaver signal:
dbus-monitor --session \
          "type='signal',interface='org.gnome.ScreenSaver',member='SessionIdleChanged'"


2,2.22.1,GNOME Power Manager:
===============================
	GNOME Power Manager is a GNOME session daemon that acts as a policy agent on top of the Project Utopia stack, which includes the kernel, hotplug, udev, and HAL. GNOME Power Manager listens for HAL events and responds with user-configurable reactions.

GNOME Power Manager comes in three parts:

	- gnome-power-manager:	    the manager daemon itself
	- gnome-power-preferences:  the control panel program, for configuration
	- gnome-power-statistics:   the statistics graphing program

To build, GNOME Power Manager requires

	- libgnomeui-2.0
	- libglade-2.0
	- libhal-0 (from HAL 0.5.7 , 0.5.8 recommended)
	- libdbus-1 (from D-BUS 0.70 or later)
	- libdbus-glib-1 (from D-BUS 0.70 or later)
	- libnotify (from 0.3.0 or later, 0.4.3 recommended)
To work properly, gnome-power-manager requires hald to be running.

DBUS相关信息：
==========
The interfaces are session-wide.
DBUS Service:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement

-------
DBUS Interface:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement
DBUS Path:/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement
DBUS methods:
Suspend
Attempt to suspend the system.

Hibernate
Attempt to hibernate the system.

Shutdown
Attempt to shutdown the system.

Reboot
Attempt to reboot the system.

CanSuspend
If the current session user is able to suspend the system.

CanHibernate
If the current session user is able to hibernate the system.

-------
NON STANDARDISED API
DBUS Interface:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Backlight
DBUS Path:/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Backlight
DBUS methods:
GetBrightness
Returns the current backlight brightness as a percentage.

SetBrightness
                This may not immediately set the brightness if we are in a
                low power sleep mode, if the panel is switched off, or if the
                panel is in an idle dim state.

-------
NON STANDARDISED API
DBUS Interface:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Widget
DBUS Path:/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Widget
DBUS methods:
GetDescription
Returns the system state description, e.g. Laptop battery 34 minutes until charged (34%).

-------
NON STANDARDISED API
DBUS Interface:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Inhibit
DBUS Path:/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Inhibit
        When the power manager detects an idle session and system, it can perform
        a system suspend or hibernate, known as an idle sleep action.
        We can prevent the session power manager daemon from doing this action
        using the inhibit interface.

-------
DBUS Interface:org.freedesktop.PowerManagement.Statistics
DBUS Path:/org/freedesktop/PowerManagement/Statistics
        Statistics data are values that can be collected by the power manager
        for review or profiling.
        These allow the user to profile power saving methods, usually shown
        to the user in the form of a graph.
