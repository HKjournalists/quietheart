X Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) 

DPMS extension设计的目标是提供一个传统screen saver的逻辑扩展。
它的执行独立于screensa，。塔河screen saver交互，并且DPMS能够服从用户或者screen saver应用程序。

VESA（ Video Electronics Standards Association）规定了四种电源状态：
0 DPMSModeOn      显示器打开状态中
1 DPMSModeStandby 最轻度的节省电源，切换较快，这种状态会把显示器的水平同步信号关掉。
2 DPMSModeSuspend 中度节省电源，切换速度稍慢，这种状态会把显示器的垂直同步信号关掉。
3 DPMSModeOff     最大程度节省电源，切换速度慢于前两个，它会关闭垂直和水平同步信号。




standby_timeout is the amount of time of inactivity before standby mode
will be invoked. This is the lightest level of power savings, and the monitor is generally immediately ready
upon detection of user activity. This is most often implemented by shutting off the horizontal sync signal to
the monitor. A value of zero disables this mode.



standby_timeout implemented by shutting off the horizontal sync signal to the monitor. 

suspend_timeou is the middle level of power savings, resulting in a slightly longer recovery upon
detection of activity. Suspend mode is most often implemented by pulsing the horizontal sync signal, and
removing the vertical sync signal. 

off_timeout specifies the amount of time of inactivity before the monitor is shut off. Off mode is the
deepest level of power management, resulting in the greatest power savings and the longest recovery time.
Off mode is most often implemented by removing both the horizontal and vertical signals. A value of zero
disables this mode.




The values of successive power levels must be greater than or equal to the value of the previous (non-zero)
level. A BadValue error is generated if an illegal combination is detected.
