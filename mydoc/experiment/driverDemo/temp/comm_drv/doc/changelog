this file backup good features.
current good feature is:
1)devices count is 32;
2)ioctl commands and app build framework;
3)ioctl creat command can create and release table blocks with list;
4)send data;
5)receive data;
6)mutithread receive data;
7)block/nonblock mode.

problem:
1)driver init check.
2)driver number is fixed static number.
3)table block create needs to protect.
4)no sync for multi thread.
5)semaphore cann't work
