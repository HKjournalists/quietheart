(1)be it
By facility, we mean a new functionality, be it a whole driver or a new software abstraction, that can be accessed by an application. 
关键是那个"be it"是什么句法？谢谢！

回复1：
be it a whole driver or a new software abstraction =  whether it is a whole driver or a new software abstraction

回复2：
By facility, we mean a new functionality, be it a whole driver or a new software abstraction, that can be accessed by an application.
可以理解我By facility, we mean a new functionality that can be accessed by an application, it may be a whole driver or a new software abstraction.
be it 这句是对new functionalty 的解释说明，如果提前放在句中，必须倒装
